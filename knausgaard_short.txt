Slowly my two suitcases glided around on the carousel in the arrivals hall. They were old, from the end of the 1960s, I had found them among Mom's things in the barn when we were about to move, the day before the removal van came, and I immediately commandeered them, they suited me and my style, the not-quite-contemporary, the not-quite-streamlined, which was what I favored.
I stubbed the cigarette out in the ashtray stand by the wall, lifted the cases off the carousel, and carried them outside.
It was five minutes to seven.
I lit another cigarette. There was no hurry, there was nothing I had to do, no one I had to meet.
The sky was overcast, but the air was still sharp and clear. There was something alpine about the landscape even though the airport I was standing outside was only a few meters above sea level. The few trees I could see were stunted and misshapen. The mountain peaks on the horizon were white with snow.
