In the dirty main street the stalls were set up, and the boats were
dragged towards the sea moving up in shelves, as in old prints.
At Bluebeard's, blood flowed, in abattoirs, in circuses, where
the seal of God blanched the windows. Blood and milk flowed.
Beavers built. In bars and cafes, fierce coffees steamed.
In the great house of window-panes still running with water, the
children in mourning looked at the marvellous pictures.
A door slammed shut, and, on the village square, the child whirled
his arms, recognized by weathervanes and steeplecocks everywhere,
under the brilliant sudden shower.
